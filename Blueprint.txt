Sidescroller: Pineapple Sunrise

Our plan:
	Andre:

	Austin:

	Nick: HUD, Enemies

Figure this stuff out:
	Implement repeating sprites, so you can have a larger platform
	Image skips when jumping up through non-solid platform
	Title Screen
	Animate Player
	HUD interface
	Sun move across level (timer maybe)
	Enemies

Tasks:
	Levels
	Logic
	Sprites
	Title Screen
	Level select, etc.
	Scene transitions
	Loading, level select, download sprites, etc.
Maybe later:
	Score
	High scores
