Sidescroller: Pineapple Sunrise

Our plan:

Goals:
	HUD interface
	Text that appears only on collision with an object
	Create new player sprite (for when I get an artist)
	Sun move across level (timer maybe)
		when you die the sun moves a certain amount, making the timer go down
	Leaping monsters
	Smooth viewport scrolling
	Implement powerups

Bugs:
	Image skips when jumping up through non-solid platform
	When on normal platforms the character sometimes shifts down one pixel to "rest" on the block
	Character does not rest on downward moving platform

Power-ups:
	-Chili pepper of fire
	-Avocado of speed
	-Ice cream of ice
	-Coconut shell of shielding
