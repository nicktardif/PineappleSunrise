Sidescroller: Pineapple Sunrise

Our plan:
	Austin:
	Nick: HUD, Enemies

Goals:
	Implement repeating sprites, so you can have a larger platform
	Title Screen
	HUD interface
	Create new player sprite
	Move level layout to external file
	Sun move across level (timer maybe)
	Enemies
	Smoother movement
	Weapons and attacks

Bugs:
	Jump through the springs and stuff
	Disappearing blocks don't always trigger
	Image skips when jumping up through non-solid platform

Tasks:
	Levels
	Logic
	Sprites
	Title Screen
	Level select, etc.
	Scene transitions
	Loading, level select, download sprites, etc.
