Sidescroller: Pineapple Sunrise

Our plan:

Goals:
	Implement repeating sprites, so you can have a larger platform
	HUD interface
	Create new player sprite
	Move level layout to external file
	Sun move across level (timer maybe)
		when you die the sun moves a certain amount, making the timer go down
	Enemies
	Leaping monsters
	Smooth viewport scrolling

Bugs:
	Jump through the springs and stuff
	Disappearing blocks don't always trigger
	Image skips when jumping up through non-solid platform


Power-ups:
	-Chili pepper of fire
	-Avocado of speed
	-Ice cream of ice
	-Coconut shell of shielding
